This repositoryüóÑÔ∏è holds files used in a tutorial on the visualizing age-sex composition of Coronavirus confirmed cases in Eswatini. You can find the tutorial on my [personal website](https://e.olamijuwon.com/visualizing-age-sex-composition-of-confirmed-covid-19-cases-in-eswatini/). In the tutorial, I attempted to visualize the changes in the age-sex composition of confirmed cases of Coronavirus from March 2020 to December 2020. The animation shows a rapid increase in the number of deaths from Coronavirus in December. More importantly, the highest proportion of deaths from the virus are concentrated in the age groups above 40 years, with very few deaths under 30 years of age. Altogether, the animation presents one of the many benefits of age-sex disaggregated data overtime. You can see here for a [**commentary**](https://theconversation.com/flaws-in-the-collection-of-african-population-statistics-block-covid-19-insights-142669) by my colleagues and me.
