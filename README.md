This repository:file_cabinet: holds files used in a tutorial on the visualizing age-sex composition of Coronavirus confirmed cases in Eswatini. You can find the tutorial on my [personal website](https://e.olamijuwon.com/visualizing-age-sex-composition-of-confirmed-covid-19-cases-in-eswatini/). In the tutorial, I attempted to visualize the changes in the age-sex composition of confirmed cases of Coronavirus from March 2020 to December 2020. The animation shows a rapid increase in the number of deaths from Coronavirus in December. More importantly, the highest proportion of deaths from the virus are concentrated in the age groups above 40 years, with very few deaths under 30 years of age. Altogether, the animation presents one of the many benefits of age-sex disaggregated data overtime. You can see here for a [**commentary**](https://theconversation.com/flaws-in-the-collection-of-african-population-statistics-block-covid-19-insights-142669) by my colleagues and me.

While you are here, did you know that Eswatini has recorded a total of 253 new deaths from COVID-19 complications in the first 20 days of 2021? That is 48 more deaths than the total reported deaths from COVID19 complication from March to December 2020. Also noteworthy is that the Central Statistical Office counted the population of Eswatini as 1,093,238 at the 2017 population and housing census. As at the date of reporting, a total of 14,219 confirmed cases of coronavirus has been recorded in the country. A R script to replicate the graph can be accessed [here](trendViz.R)
